/*
 * This macro can be copy-pasted to the text field in the Batch (macro) plugin.
 * It provides a template, for the execution of custom macro-commands on the successive images as selected in the Batch (macro) plugin.
 * 
 * The image path is communicated from the Batch (macro) plugin to the macro as a String argument, which can be recovered using the getArgument() command.
 * The image is then opened (and displayed if BatchMode is not set to true).
 * Custom commands are executed and the image is closed.
 * 
 * NOTE : When open via the menu ACQUIFER > Examples, this script file opens as a temporary file.
 * Changes to this file will thus NOT be saved, in particular the next time you open this example via the menu, the original example will be shown.
 * Use File > Save As... to save a copy of this example, and keep your modifications.
 * You can also find all the examples on the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/acquifer/Fiji-examples
