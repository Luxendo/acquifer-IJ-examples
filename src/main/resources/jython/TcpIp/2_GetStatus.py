"""
REQUIREMENTS
- running the script on a control PC/HIVE connected to the IM
- have the IM software opened in parallel of Fiji
- the option "Block remote connection" of the IM software disabled in the admin panel (contact your system administrator or the acquifer support)

This scripts demonstrates a number of values which can be recovered from the Imaging Machine such as temperature, current axis position...

See the API documentation for the list of commands available by TcpIp and their docstrings.

# Mode, either script/live
# In live mode, any change is reflected directly in the IM software ex : switching on/off light sources
# Script mode should be used for repetitive calls to the command acquire, which requires the script mode.

# In script mode, interaction with the graphical user interface of the IM software are not possible
# Use myIM.setMode("live") / myIM.setMode("script") to change the current mode
