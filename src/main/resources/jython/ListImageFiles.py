"""
This jython script demonstrates how to list image files from an Imaging Machine experiment directory.
A similar result can be obtained in the macro language, using the "Batch Process Images (macro)" plugin, and using in the text input the following commands

imagePath = getArgument(); // get image path for the current iteration
print(imagePath)

Back to jython, the code below uses the function getListImageFiles from acquifer.im04.FileUtils.
This function accepts optional filters in the form of lists, to return only image files for a specific well, subposition, channel, timepoint or Z-slice.
The list of files is then parsed to extract the metadata for each image file.

The script relies on the acquifer-core java package, provided with the acquifer update site.
This script can be run in the Fiji script editor, and requires a dataset of IM images.
Similar scripts in other scripting language can be written by adapting the import statements and general syntax.

NOTE : When open via the menu ACQUIFER > Examples, this script file opens as a temporary file.
Changes to this file will thus NOT be saved, in particular the next time you open this example via the menu, the original example will be shown.
Use File > Save As... to save a copy of this example, and keep your modifications.
You can also find all the examples on the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/acquifer/Fiji-examples
