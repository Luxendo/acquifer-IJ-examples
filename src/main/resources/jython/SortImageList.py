"""
Once images from a directory are listed, and metadata extracted, one can sort the list of images in a custom order of dimensions.
The default sorting order is as following (well, subposition, timepoint, Z-slice, -channel).
-channel means that the channels are sorted in reverse order, ie channel 6 (Brightfield) first.

This script takes a image directory and return the list of IM image files first unsorted and then sorted using the default order.

NOTE : When open via the menu ACQUIFER > Examples, this script file opens as a temporary file.
Changes to this file will thus NOT be saved, in particular the next time you open this example via the menu, the original example will be shown.
Use File > Save As... to save a copy of this example, and keep your modifications.
