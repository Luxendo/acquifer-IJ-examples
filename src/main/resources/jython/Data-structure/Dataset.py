"""
This snippet demonstrates the use of the Dataset object, which represents a view of an IM experiment directory. 
A Dataset is a fixed view of an IM directory : depending on optional dimension filters it may not represent the full image directory. 
To create a dataset, one uses a DatasetBuilder, which provides a convenient syntax for optional dimensions filtering and sorting. 
The dataset is recovered from the Builder by calling the method build. 
Image files in a Dataset are represented as ImagePlane.
