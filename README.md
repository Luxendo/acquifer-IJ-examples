# acquifer-IJ-examples
 Dedicated jar package to populate the example and documentation entries of the ACQUIFER menu in Fiji.  
 The package basically contains a single-class which is repsonsible for opening the example scripts in the script editor.  
 There is then one entry in the ImageJ1 style plugins.config file, for each example script that should be listed in the menu.  
 
 ## TODO
The examples could be stored as part of the jar, and with the pom of the jar one could thus define what version of the package (acquifer-IJ, acquifer-core) should be used.
